_helm-utils_ provides some complementary utilities for [helm](https://helm.sh), both as CLI-tool and node.js library.

_Note: The author of this library/CLI-tool is everything else than a helm expert. It might be that I have re-implemented something which is anyhow already available in helm. If this is the case, please shoot me a message and raise an [issue]({%= bugs.url%}). Thx._
